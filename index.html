       Ara's philosophy on photography is that he attaches great
       importance to the presence of humans in photography and
       considers himself as a visual historian. According to him,
       photography should provide people with memory of their
       suffering and their life. He feels that art can lie but 
       photography only reflects the reality. He does not value art
       in photography so he prefers photojournalism.
