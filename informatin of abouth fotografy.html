			<dt><strong>Is Digital Better than Film?</strong></dt>
				<dd>
		I know better than to engage in that debate! There are still many 
		photographers who swear by the unique qualities that film brings to
		their images. Film and digital each have their pros and cons. 
		Before I get into the tips basic digital photography, I’ll share
		with you what I think are some of the advantages of digital over film.

		<table><tr>
			
			<td>Digital photography is by no means “free.” You have 
			the cost of your camera, your computer, memory, hard drives
			, software, and more! However, that cost is amortized a 
			little differently than the costs associated with film 
			photography. With film photography, every time you click t
			he shutter, it costs you money. That image has to be 
			processed by a Lab, and you pay for it.
			<br/>
			With digital photography, once you have paid your up-front 
			costs, there is no “cost per click.” I find that very 
			liberating. I no longer have to worry about how much 
			it’s costing me every time I release the shutter. 
			That encourages me to experiment more with new techniques
		    and styles. I can “try it” just to see what will happen,
		    without feeling like I’m wasting film. Experimentation
		    is the best way I know to learn, so this freedom has had 
			a positive impact on my photography.
			
			<p>With film photography, you have to wait to see your
			 results. Sometimes, it will be a week or more between 
			 clicking the shutter and seeing the resulting image.
			 In the meantime, I guarantee you’ll forget what you 
			 were thinking at the time you took the shot! I’ve 
			 tried keeping little notebooks to record the settings 
			 I used, but frankly, it wasn’t very effective. For one 
			 thing, next time I head out to shoot, the light will
			 likely be different, so my settings will need to be
			 different too.
				</br>
			 What I really want is instant feedback. And I can have that 
			 with digital! Right there in the field, I can see whether
		     my settings 
			 are working, and adjust them if they are not. If I’m not
			 getting enough
			 motion blur, or I don’t have enough depth of field, I can 
			 correct the 
			 problem there and then. This helps me to make better images
			, and not
			<q>blow </q>a great photographic opportunity. Getting 
			instant feedback 
			is also an excellent way to learn digital photography 
			for beginners.

		<h2 style="text-align:left;">Freedom to choose settings on a per-shot basis</h2>
		<p "font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;font-size: 27px;">
		
	In the days of film (Yes, I talk about them like they are over!
	For me, they are!), certain choices you made had to last for 
	an entire roll of film. For example, you chose your ISO
    setting through your selection of film, for example, 
    Agfa Ultra 50 (with an ISO rating of 50), or Fuji Superia 
    400 (with an ISO rating of 400). You were then stuck with
    your choice for 24 or 36 exposures. Many photographers 
    kept two bodies around, each loaded with a different film 
	speed, so that they had some choice.</br>

    One of the pluses in basic digital photography is that today, with
    digital, you have the freedom to switch your ISO setting on a per
   -image basis, which gives you complete flexibility.</br>

    Similarly, you can switch your white balance on a per-image basis
  , rather than being locked in to an entire roll of tungsten film, for example.

			Basic digital photography starts with understanding your
			camera. Do you need a DSLR (what is a DSLR, anyway)? 
		    How many megapixels are enough? What is a sensor? 
		    What does “full frame” mean? I try to answer these
		    digital photography for beginners questions for you 
		    in this section.</br>

					Noise isn’t just something your teenagers make!
				    It can also show up in your digital photographs.

					Find out the pros and cons of RAW vs JPEG. 
					Which format should you shoot in? Learn about both
					file formats, and which is best for you.
					
					Sensor dust can spoil your images and cost you time
					 in post-processing. Learn about camera sensor 
					 cleaning, and keeping it clean. This is one of 
					 the more practical tips for taking digital photography.

					Finally, take a peek inside my camera bag, and 
					find out what tools I use.

					In these informal reviews of professional 
					photography equipment, I share my thoughts on
				    the gear I use, from my camera to the bag I
				    carry it in. You might find some ideas for
				    new photography toys you want!
